# val.just-be.dev

This is a cloudflare workers project to set up a special wildcard subdomain to point to [val.town](https://val.town).
Note that to use this you'll be required to purchase advanced TLS certs from cloudflare for $10 a month (as of when I set this up).

If/when val.town supports this it'll be easier just to go through them. Upvote [this discussion](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/2)
if it's a feature you'd like to see.
